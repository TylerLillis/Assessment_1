        <h4> Personal Introduction </h4>
        <p> Hey, I’m student 3947709, or I guess if you want to use my real name
           its Tyler Lillis. I’m a third generation Australian from multiple
           European backgrounds, but the third generation comes from my Maltese
           family. I studied from prep to year 6 all at Chirnside Park Primary
           School and then continued and did years 7 to 12 at Lilydale High School.
           Yeah, a bit of a distance away from uni oops but I make it work. I
           speak English and have miserably failed in learning Indonesian, French
           and even a bit of Japanese (mainly for anime)
        </p>

        <h4> Ideal Career in IT </h4>
        <p> The position is to be a junior cyber security analyst which would be a
          great steppingstone to getting into a bigger and better job within the cyber security field.
          The required skills for this job are to learn basics and some advanced skills
          for the job by knowing some programming languages and programs that would be
          used within the job. Being able to use and understand the programs that they
          list would greatly help you in getting the job and making it into something.
          I currently do not have any of the required skills for this job but am planning
          to take the networking course as my minor during my degree in university to
          help me learn the required skills for this job. I will also be doing the
          programming courses to help me in progressing easier.

        <h4> Interest in IT </h4>
        <p> I have always had a passion for learning code and being able to program a
          game, but over the years I have begun expanding more on that and started wanting
          to program as many things as possible. I also began getting into cyber security
          more recently especially after all the attacks that went on during the
          lockdowns and covid. My main interest in IT came when my friends and I used to
          play Star Wars battlefront on the PlayStation 4 together and want to make a
          cool open world Star Wars game (which is now apparently in the works) due to
          our love of Star Wars and thinking about how awesome it would be to make a game
          like that ourselves
        </p><p>
          I chose to go to RMIT as I was able to get the most opportunities in the
          field of IT through them and study more of what I want to. I expect to
          learn the skills and requirements it will take to get me out into the
          IT industry fields that I would love to get into in my future, these being
          game development or cyber security meaning I would love to learn how to code
          on advanced levels and be able to understand advanced code. I would also love
          to learn the security aspect too, learn how to keep myself and everyone else
          around me safe on the internet and stop people from being able to access data
          and sites that they should not be able to get too.

        <h4> Personal Profile </h4>
        <div class="sixteenPerson">
        <h5> 16 Personality Test </h5>
        <p>
          Mind – 		75% Introvert		25% Extrovert </p><p>
          Energy – 	70% Observant		30% Intuitive </p><p>
          Nature – 	52% Thinking 		48% Feeling </p><p>
          Tactics – 	54% Prospecting 	46% Judging  </p><p>
          Identity – 	74% Turbulent 		26% Assertive  </p><p>
          In the 16 personality test they all describe me decently as I am often
          quite introverted and keep to myself a bit. I observe things and understand
          what I am seeing but I am often not able to do it for myself even after
          viewing and understanding, I think and feel for people quiet a lot which is
          why they are both quiet even in score similarly to how I judge whilst I am
          searching for things so I can find what I want in something or someone. I am
          not too assertive and rather sit back and just do what I am told to do.

      <div class="Big5">
        <h5> Big 5 Test </h5>
          <p>Factor 1 – Extraversion 		 (Low score) </p><p>
            Factor 2 – Emotional Stability		(Medium score)</p><p>
            Factor 3 – Agreeableness 		(High score) </p><p>
            Factor 4 – Conscientiousness 		(High score) </p><p>
            Factor 5 – Intellect / Imagination 	(High score) </p><p>
            Factor 1 of the big 5 test describes me very well as I am not
            extroverted in any way, factor 2 describes me decently as I can be
            quite good with my emotions but sometimes, I do struggle as many others
            do. Factor 3 does not represent me as well as I expected, whilst it was a
            high score, I still expected it to be higher as I tend to try and agree with
            people as much as possible and understand them through agreeing. Factor 4
            describes me well as I really aim to get my job done efficiently and
            effectively and make sure it is done to the correct standard. Factor 5 as a
            high score both does and does not make sense as I can be intelligent at times,
            but I have a horrible imagination, I tend to struggle with seeing things that
            are not happening or have happened in front of me in the past.

      <div class="LearningStyle">
      <h5>Learning Style Test </h5>
      <p> Auditory – 10% </p><p>
      Visual – 60% </p><p>
      Tactile – 30% </p><p>
        The Learning style test I feel describes my learning well as I struggle
        with learning just from listening and would rather see what has been done
        so I can replicate it and then start to be able to do it for myself. The
        little amount of tactile makes a bit of sense for me too as sometimes making
        it more engaging by bringing some activities that pique my interest will make
        it easier for me to learn it too!

      <div class="ProjectIdea">
        <h4> Project Idea</h4>
        <p> My project idea is to create a discord bot that can help with Destiny 2
          discord servers but also be progressed in the future to help with other games
          and aspects. The aim is for it to be able to create LFGs for people to be able
          to join and squad up together whilst also being able to show the weekly
          rotations for the main activities in the game including the weekly raid
          challenges and trials rotations!
        </p><p>

          This would be useful to help keep Destiny clans up to date with what is
          happening in destiny without having to go around to multiple websites to
          find out every single bit of news. It would also allow for people to pre plan
          running activities like raids and other higher-level activities.
        </p><p>

          The bot would be able to have the weekly nightfall and its drops be shown,
          and for those wanting to do it on higher difficulties it would show each of the
          modifiers for those difficulties. At the start of the week, it would show what
          the trials loot and drops will be for the weekend before it comes around, so
          people know if they need to make some time out of their days to try and farm
          for the absolute god roll that weekend. The bright dust section of the
          eververse store will be shown for people to see what they would like to
          purchase and there will be a section you can go to so that you can see all the
          upcoming rotations within the store too! When creating an LFG, it will have the
          option to select whether it will be a teaching or an experienced run so that
          people will be able to know if they should / can enter the run, it will
          continue asking for if you would like to do a raid, strike, crucible, trials,
          gambit, or pinnacle activity. If you select any of them apart from raid the
          next step will be to put in the time and a little description if you would
          like people to know anything extra. But if you select a raid, it will ask you
          to select which raid before going to the next step.
        </p><p>

          To create this, I would need to have the bot or I to have access to the
          game files to be able to find out what the upcoming schedule is so it can
          either auto update or I can manually do it prior to that week coming up.
          I would need to be able to code in python using a programming application
          that allows for python to be used (e.g., Notepad++ or Visual Studio). I
          would need access to discord to create an account that is allowed to be a
          bot and make changes to servers and people.
        </p><p>
          This would require me to know python and understand how to program in
          discords own little twist.  This would also require me to have a computer
          with the power to be able to run the applications for making and changing
          what the bot can do.
        </p><p>
          If this bot were to work, it would help with discord servers that play
          destiny or are devoted to destiny as their main game. It would allow them to
          get everyone a bit more of an understanding of what is happening and join in
          on more activities together to expand as a community and grow in the game
          together!
